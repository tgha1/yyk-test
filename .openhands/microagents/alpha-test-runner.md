# Alpha Test Runner Microagent

This microagent is designed to run tests when triggered by the keyword "Alpha".

## Purpose

The Alpha Test Runner microagent provides the capability to execute test suites and handle test-related operations in the repository.

## Capabilities

When activated by the trigger word "Alpha", this microagent can:

- Execute test suites using common testing frameworks
- Run unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
- Handle test configuration and setup
- Report test results and failures
- Support multiple testing frameworks (pytest, jest, mocha, etc.)

## Usage

Simply mention "Alpha" in your conversation to activate this microagent's test running capabilities.

## Test Execution

The microagent will:

1. Detect the testing framework used in the project
2. Locate test files and configuration
3. Execute the appropriate test commands
4. Provide detailed output and results
5. Handle test failures and provide debugging information

## Supported Test Frameworks

- Python: pytest, unittest, nose
- JavaScript/Node.js: jest, mocha, jasmine

- Ruby: RSpec, minitest
- And many others based on project configuration

## Error Handling

If tests fail, the microagent will:
- Provide clear error messages
- Show which tests failed and why
- Suggest potential fixes when possible
- Help with debugging test issues

## Environment Setup

The microagent will automatically:
- Install missing test dependencies when possible
- Set up test environments
- Configure test databases or mock services as needed
- Handle environment variables for testing

## Examples

Common test commands that will be executed:
- `pytest` for Python projects
- `npm test` for Node.js projects
